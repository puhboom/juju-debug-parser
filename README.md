## Prompt

In the next stage of the recruitment process, we'd like to explore your development skill set by asking you to write a small tool. We'll use this to evaluate how you approach problems and realize solutions via code. 

Juju generates debug log files. These files all have charm unit names, timestamps and a log message that includes a severity. However, whilst log files are a great thing to have, they often have a lot of ‘noise’ in them. A Juju log file from a deployment is included with this task. Some of the lines don’t “look” like log lines in that they are not prefixed with a Juju unit name; these should be ignored.

Your task is to develop a command line tool in Python 3. It will need to accept one mandatory parameter and one optional parameter:

* The mandatory parameter is the filename of the log file
* The optional parameter is a charm name.

The command line program should read the log file looking for log messages with severities of “INFO”, “DEBUG”, “WARNING”, “ERROR”. If the charm name is included in the parameters then it should ignore all the other charms’ log outputs.

The the program should output:

1. The charms that produced warning messages (if not restricted to a single charm)
2. The number of each severity of message.
3. The number of duplicate messages (and their severity).
4. The proportions of each type of log message for each charm (or just the single charm).
5. The total number of log messages per charm.
6. The total number of log messages.

You should use standard library functions that help you simplify the problem plus any modules available on PyPi. Be sure to include any tests used to verify your solution.

It will be good if the code is accompanied by a 1-page report of the work that you have done including the time you actually spent working on it. Please also state any assumptions you made to simplify the problem.

Please try to restrict your work to a 24-hour time box, or even try to complete it in a single sitting if you can. The goal of this exercise is not to build a feature rich application, but to see how you approach a complex problem with a time constraint. Feel free to reach out with any questions you have.


## General Approach

1. Create regular expression to filter log lines of interest
2. Parse data into working memory (inefficient, but this is a small local operation)
3. Perform book keeping
    1. For each charm, for each severity, count number of messages
    2. If WARNING, add charm to list
    3. Create unique messages set to track duplicate messages & counts
4. Print outputs
    4. If charm specified, print total number of messages, print report of duplicates, and print breakdown of severity
    5. If not specified, 
        1. List charms with WARNINGs
        2. List breakdown of severity
        3. Print report of duplicates
        4. Per charm,
            1. print total number of entries, 
            2. print counts and percentages per severity
5. Handle script arguments, and call juju_log_summary function


## Synopsis of Script Development

I wrote this script quickly using ChatGPT Plus against the ChatGPT 3.5 model as an aid. I iterated through 6 generated scripts before launching into my customization. Each generated script contained pieces of the puzzle of how I wanted to approach breaking out the log parser, and allowed me to refine my query to the ChatGPT3 May 12 Version.

Each version provided loose interpretations of what I asked for, so it was necessary for me to clean up nomenclature throughout, and provide appropriate order of execution architecture/structure around the provided scripts. I was delighted with how easily the tool provided the regex filtering. 

I truncated the provided log file in a few ways to verify that my outputs change appropriately to the log file inputs. Thereafter, I performed a lot of iterative development and chased down syntax errors as I created them. I have attached each of the chat generated python files that I worked from so you can see the references that I used when coding this log parser, as well as the shortened log text files that I used to verify the outputs were consistent with the input data.

In total I spent about 4 hours developing and refining what I think is a fully featured as-requested log parsing script. There’s likely significant room for improvement in reducing the number of for loops in use, but at small log sizes it’s unlikely that those issues will become readily apparent. I’m happy with this for a first stab.


## Input File Notes

juju-debug.txt contains the originally provided log file

juju-debug-short.txt contains the top 50 or so lines of the log

juju-debug-someWARNs.txt was excerpted from somewhere in the middle of the log


## ChatGPT Transcript


#### Patrick

can you make me a python script that parses juju debug log files?


#### ChatGPT


##### Certainly! I can help you with that. Here's an example Python script that parses Juju debug log files:


##### python
```
import re
from datetime import datetime
def parse_juju_debug_log(log_file):
    log_entries = []
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        log_lines = f.readlines()
        entry = None
        for line in log_lines:
            if line.startswith('[') and line[18:20] == '] ':
                if entry:
                    log_entries.append(entry)
                entry = {'timestamp': None, 'message': ''}
                try:
                    entry['timestamp'] = datetime.strptime(line[1:17], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
                except ValueError:
                    pass
                entry['message'] = line[20:].strip()
            elif entry:
                entry['message'] += line.strip()
        if entry:
            log_entries.append(entry)
    return log_entries
# Usage example
log_file_path = '/path/to/your/log/file.log'
parsed_logs = parse_juju_debug_log(log_file_path)
for log_entry in parsed_logs:
    timestamp = log_entry['timestamp']
    message = log_entry['message']
    print(f'Timestamp: {timestamp}, Message: {message}')
```

##### Here's how the script works:

The function parse_juju_debug_log takes the path to the Juju debug log file as an input.

It opens the log file and reads its contents.

It iterates over each line of the log file, identifying log entries based on the timestamp format ([YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]).

Each log entry is stored as a dictionary with 'timestamp' and 'message' keys.

The function returns a list of log entries.

In the usage example, you can provide the path to your Juju debug log file.

The function parse_juju_debug_log is called with the log file path, and the returned log entries are printed.

Please note that this script assumes a specific format for the Juju debug log file, with timestamps enclosed in square brackets followed by a space. You may need to modify the parsing logic if your log file has a different format.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!


#### Patrick

my log file is below. help adapt my python logfile script to list the number of types of error messages (DEBUG, INFO, etc.), as well as other summarizing statistics


#### ChatGPT

To adapt the Python script to list the number of types of error messages (DEBUG, INFO, etc.) and provide other summarizing statistics, you can make a few modifications to the existing code. Here's an updated version of the script:


##### python
```
import re

from datetime import datetime

from collections import Counter

def parse_juju_debug_log(log_file):

    log_entries = []

    error_types = Counter()
```
   


#### Patrick

here's the logfile sample :

#### ChatGPT

Thank you for providing the logfile sample. Based on the provided sample, I've updated the Python script to include the number of error message types (DEBUG, INFO, etc.) and other summarizing statistics. Here's the modified script:


##### python
```
import re
from datetime import datetime
from collections import Counter
def parse_juju_debug_log(log_file):
    log_entries = []
    error_types = Counter()
    timestamps = []
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        log_lines = f.readlines()
        for line in log_lines:
            match = re.match(r'^([^:]+): (\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}) (\S+) (.*)$', line)
            if match:
                component = match.group(1)
                timestamp = match.group(2)
                error_type = match.group(3)
                message = match.group(4)
                log_entry = {'component': component, 'timestamp': timestamp, 'error_type': error_type, 'message': message}
                log_entries.append(log_entry)
                error_types[error_type] += 1
                timestamps.append(datetime.strptime(timestamp, '%H:%M:%S'))
    
    return log_entries, error_types, timestamps
# Usage example
log_file_path = '/path/to/your/log/file.log'
parsed_logs, error_types, timestamps = parse_juju_debug_log(log_file_path)
# Print the number of error message types
print('Error Message Types:')
for error_type, count in error_types.items():
    print(f'{error_type}: {count}')
# Print other summarizing statistics
total_entries = len(parsed_logs)
total_errors = sum(error_types.values())
earliest_timestamp = min(timestamps)
latest_timestamp = max(timestamps)
print(f'Total log entries: {total_entries}')
print(f'Total error entries: {total_errors}')
print(f'Earliest timestamp: {earliest_timestamp}')
print(f'Latest timestamp: {latest_timestamp}')
```
In this updated script, the parse_juju_debug_log function now also tracks the number of error message types using a Counter object called error_types. It also stores the timestamps in a separate list called timestamps.

After parsing the log file, the script prints the number of error message types and provides other summarizing statistics, including the total number of log entries, total number of error entries, earliest timestamp, and latest timestamp.

Remember to replace '/path/to/your/log/file.log' with the actual path to your Juju debug log file.

Let me know if you have any further questions!


#### Patrick

can you adjust the python file to do teh following? The the program should output:

The charms that produced warning messages (if not restricted to a single charm)

The number of each severity of message.

The number of duplicate messages (and their severity).

The proportions of each type of log message for each charm (or just the single charm).

The total number of log messages per charm.

The total number of log messages.


#### ChatGPT

Certainly! I have modified the Python script to include the additional functionality you requested. Here's the updated script:


##### python
```
import re
from datetime import datetime
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
def parse_juju_debug_log(log_file):
    log_entries = []
    error_types = Counter()
    charms_warnings = defaultdict(set)
    duplicate_messages = Counter()
    charm_log_counts = defaultdict(Counter)
    
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        log_lines = f.readlines()
        for line in log_lines:
            match = re.match(r'^([^:]+): (\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}) (\S+) (.*)$', line)
            if match:
                component = match.group(1)
                timestamp = match.group(2)
                error_type = match.group(3)
                message = match.group(4)
                log_entry = {'component': component, 'timestamp': timestamp, 'error_type': error_type, 'message': message}
                log_entries.append(log_entry)
                error_types[error_type] += 1
                
                if error_type == 'WARNING':
                    charm = re.match(r'^([^\s]+).*$', component).group(1)
                    charms_warnings[charm].add(message)
                
                charm_log_counts[component][error_type] += 1
        
        for charm, log_count in charm_log_counts.items():
            total_logs = sum(log_count.values())
            print(f'Total log messages for {charm}: {total_logs}')
            print(f'Proportions of log messages for {charm}:')
            for error_type, count in log_count.items():
                proportion = count / total_logs
                print(f'{error_type}: {proportion * 100:.2f}%')
            print('')
    
    total_logs = len(log_entries)
    print(f'Total log messages: {total_logs}')
    
    print('\nCharms that produced warning messages:')
    for charm, warnings in charms_warnings.items():
        print(f'{charm}:')
        for warning in warnings:
            print(f'  - {warning}')
        print('')
    
    print('Number of each severity of message:')
    for error_type, count in error_types.items():
        print(f'{error_type}: {count}')
    
    duplicate_logs = [log for log, count in error_types.items() if count > 1]
    print('\nNumber of duplicate messages (and their severity):')
    for log in duplicate_logs:
        duplicate_count = error_types[log]
        print(f'{log} (Severity: {duplicate_count})')
        
    return log_entries
# Usage example
log_file_path = '/path/to/your/log/file.log'
parsed_logs = parse_juju_debug_log(log_file_path)
```

##### In this updated script, I've added the following functionality:

Tracking the charms that produced warning messages: The script uses a defaultdict called charms_warnings to store the warning messages produced by each charm.

Counting the number of each severity of message: The error_types Counter object is used to keep track of the number of each severity of message.

Counting the number of duplicate messages: The duplicate_logs list is populated with logs that have more than one occurrence, and the error_types Counter object is used to determine the severity count for each duplicate log.

Proportions of each type of log message for each charm: The script calculates and prints the proportion of each log message type for each charm, based on the charm_log_counts defaultdict that counts the occurrences of each log message type for each charm.

Total number of log messages per charm and the total


#### Patrick

that's great, now instead of listing the messages per charm that produced messages, simply provide a list of the charms that produced messages. this should make the output significantly more concise.


#### ChatGPT

##### In this updated script, the charms_with_messages variable is now a set instead of a defaultdict. It keeps track of the charms that produced log messages.

Instead of listing the individual messages, the script now prints a concise list of charms that produced log messages using a loop and the charms_with_messages set.

Please replace '/path/to/your/log/file.log' with the actual path to your Juju debug log file.

Let me know if you have any further questions or requirements!


#### Patrick

when i run this script on my sample log file it detects all the messages as duplicates, so can you try a different means to detect duplicates?


#### ChatGPT

Apologies for the issue. I will modify the script to use a different method to detect duplicate log messages. Instead of relying solely on the Counter object, we'll introduce a new set to track unique log messages and check for duplicates. Here's the updated script:


##### python
```
import re
from datetime import datetime
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
def parse_juju_debug_log(log_file):
    log_entries = []
    error_types = Counter()
    charms_with_messages = set()
    unique_messages = set()
    duplicate_messages = Counter()
    charm_log_counts = defaultdict(Counter)
    
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        log_lines = f.readlines()
        for line in log_lines:
            match = re.match(r'^([^:]+): (\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}) (\S+) (.*)$', line)
            if match:
                component = match.group(1)
                timestamp = match.group(2)
                error_type = match.group(3)
                message = match.group(4)
                log_entry = {'component': component, 'timestamp': timestamp, 'error_type': error_type, 'message': message}
                log_entries.append(log_entry)
                error_types[error_type] += 1
                
                if error_type == 'WARNING':
                    charm = re.match(r'^([^\s]+).*$', component).group(1)
                    charms_with_messages.add(charm)
                
                charm_log_counts[component][error_type] += 1
                if message in unique_messages:
                    duplicate_messages[message] += 1
                else:
                    unique_messages.add(message)
        
        for charm, log_count in charm_log_counts.items():
            total_logs = sum(log_count.values())
            print(f'Total log messages for {charm}: {total_logs}')
            print(f'Proportions of log messages for {charm}:')
            for error_type, count in log_count.items():
                proportion = count / total_logs
                print(f'{error_type}: {proportion * 100:.2f}%')
            print('')
    
    total_logs = len(log_entries)
    print(f'Total log messages: {total_logs}')
    
    print('\nCharms that produced messages:')
    for charm in charms_with_messages:
        print(f'- {charm}')
    
    print('\nNumber of each severity of message:')
    for error_type, count in error_types.items():
        print(f'{error_type}: {count}')
    
    duplicate_logs = [log for log, count in duplicate_messages.items() if count > 1]
    print('\nNumber of duplicate messages (and their occurrence count):')
    for log in duplicate_logs:
        duplicate_count = duplicate_messages[log]
        print(f'{log} (Count: {duplicate_count})')
        
    return log_entries
# Usage example
log_file_path = '/path/to/your/log/file.log'
parsed_logs = parse_juju_debug_log(log_file_path)
```

##### In this updated script, I introduced the unique_messages set to keep track of unique log messages. Whenever a new log message is encountered, we check if it's already in the set. If it is, we increment the count in the duplicate_messages counter. Otherwise, we add it to the unique_messages set.

The duplicate_messages counter is used to store the count of duplicate log messages.

Please replace '/path/to/your/log/file.log' with the actual path to your Juju debug log file.

Give it a try with your sample log file, and let me know if you encounter any further issues or have any additional questions!


#### Patrick

please have the script ignore lines that aren't formatted with a charm name, then a space, then time, then a severity level, then a message

##### In this updated script, I added a continue statement to skip processing lines that don't match the specified log format. This ensures that only lines with the correct format (charm name, time, severity level, message) are processed.

##### In this updated script, the duplicate_messages counter is modified to store a boolean value for each duplicate message. We use the sum function to calculate the total number of duplicate messages by summing the values in the duplicate_messages counter.

Give it a try with your sample log file, and let me know if you encounter any further issues or have any additional questions!

Certainly! Here's a Python function that parses a log file and counts the number of types of errors:


##### python
```
import re
from collections import Counter
def count_error_types(log_file):
    error_types = Counter()
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        log_lines = f.readlines()
        for line in log_lines:
            match = re.match(r'^.* (\S+) .*$', line)
            if match:
                error_type = match.group(1)
                error_types[error_type] += 1
    
    return error_types
# Usage example
log_file_path = '/path/to/your/log/file.log'
error_counts = count_error_types(log_file_path)
print(error_counts)
```

##### In this function, we use regular expressions to extract the error types from each log line. The error types are then counted using the Counter object from the collections module.

To use this function, replace '/path/to/your/log/file.log' with the actual path to your log file.

When you run the script, it will print a Counter object that contains the counts of each error type present in the log file.

Let me know if you have any further questions!
